#Based on the plot, we can see that non-road, non-point and on-road types have seen monotone decreases in emissions from 1999â€“2008 for Baltimore City.
#On the other hand, the point type is slighlty different, it experiences the growth from 1999 to 2005, and afterward it drastically decreases in 2008.
